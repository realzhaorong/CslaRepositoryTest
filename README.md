#CSLARepositoryTest
Sample code for a series of blog posts I did back in 2008/2009 on using Dependency Injection and IOC with CSLA.NET:

* [Using Dependency Injection with CSLA.NET](http://beyondthispoint.blogspot.com/2008/12/using-dependency-injection-with-cslanet.html)
* [Using the Repository Pattern with CSLA.NET, Part 1](http://beyondthispoint.blogspot.com/2009/01/using-repository-pattern-with-cslanet.html)
* [Using the Repository Pattern with CSLA.NET, Part 2](http://beyondthispoint.blogspot.com/2009/02/using-repository-pattern-with-cslanet.html)

The code is as-is (and therefore quite old) and a number of people have attempted to get it to work with newer versions of CSLA.NET, Unity, etc.  I thought by putting it out on GitHub it would give myself and others the opportunity to improve the samples and even create branches that worked against newer versions of all the frameworks.
